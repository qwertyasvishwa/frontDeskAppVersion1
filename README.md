# frontDeskAppVersion1
Here i am developing an Welcome App for my Organisation, through which we are going to print a badge when new Visitors enters into our office. This system is inpired from Envoy. Envoy is the digital visitor registration system thatâ€™s changing how visitors are greeted in workplaces around the world. Instead of signing in using a paper sign-in sheet, visitors simply sign in on an iPad. 
The uploaded version is in Swift 2, Xcode 7 and Alamofire 3.0 
Now this has been depricated.
Current version is Swift 3, you probably usig Xcode 8 and Alamofire 4.0
